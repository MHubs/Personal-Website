    "bio":"I'm a senior at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and a software engineer who loves to help people learn and explore. I have experience creating applications used in clinical research at a Boston hospital that aim to help aid in the health and wellness of patients with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Keeping this in mind, I strive to create applications that not just researchers will use but that the patients themselves will use. I also have wide experience with relational and non-relational databases and even assist in teaching a course at UMass on the subject. When I'm not programming, I enjoy playing baseball and am even an umpire for my local town's Little League.",
